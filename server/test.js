And I like that we can pick a team, although it would be fun to have a feature where we could see if a teammate was playing at the same time and possibly work together for the challenges ...Just a thought Love this game!",

Love the game when it runs right but constantly updating the game because of so many glitches. It can be very frustrating waiting for them to correct the issues or having them just ignore your issues altogether.",

The prices & what you get for how much you're spending in order to keep on playing & having fun is key. The highest cost is not ALWAYS the best deal & the cheapest thing is usually exactly what you paid for it. I guess they never claimed that it was inexpensive entertainment !ðŸ¤·",

The game still won't load. It's frustrating because it is a fun game when it works. It's been hours and the game isn't loading.",

Plus while you are playing there are 6 ads on the left side of my screen and 5 ads on the right side of my screen. They interfere with the game. It comes off super desperate and very pathetic and very overbearing. We get it. We know you want our money. Lay off already. The makers of this game are LAME AF.",
